<%# Important that this partial has the same name as the class
We can just pull the "li" from index.html.erb
Replacing it with a render call

Here we use HTML to render a user %>

<li>
  <%# There are many cool ways to render ActiveRecord objects %>
  <%= gravatar_for user, size: 50 %>
  <%= link_to user.name, user %>
  <% if current_user.admin? && !current_user?(user) %> <%#Not == to current_user being rendered %>
    | <%= link_to "delete", user, method: :delete,
                                  data: { confirm: "Are you sure?" } %>
  <%# Lil bit of JS added ^ %>

  <%# if not added delete it'd show %>
  <% end %>



</li>
