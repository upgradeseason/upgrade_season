  %b Upgrade Season
  is about upgrading our life while acknowledging that we
  %b love
  ourselves just the way we are. Perhaps we could do better in our personal or professional lives. This could be a hobby, an aspect of our business, or a personal project.
%p A Power question to ask yourself, when considering what you do with your time
%p
  %b How well is that working out for you?

  Getting the knowledge and applying it is the key to success, with the ultimate goal of having a better life, even if
  it is something as simple as enjoying your relaxation time a bit more.
%p
  As a starting point, here are 9 parts of life, so you could pick any one or more of these, and rate yourself on a 1 through 10 scale. Then create a plan to improve that aspect, and then act according to the plan you created.
